# Web D starter
Starter pack for web project with D, Diet, Tailwind and HTMX

Currently 2 different options are available:
- Based on Serverino
- Based on Vibe.D

Both options are using Diet as a main template engine for pages.
Diet code extended with HTMX and Tailwind CSS for better usability.

Choose interested branch and run:
```bash
dub run
```

Then open `127.0.0.1:8080` in the browser
